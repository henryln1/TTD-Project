# TTD-Project
Summer project at theTradeDesk. The goal is to generate a txt file that has a match between mobile app ids and a corresponding ads.txt location on the web. 


The data will be stored in AWS and the code is being written in Python 3.7.0.


TODO 09/17/18:


Add changes from CR


Note about Expected Scale:


With the current amount of data being processed, each weekly file is about 2-4GB compressed and 8-11GB uncompressed. The number of individual lines being processed ranges from 2 to 3.5 million for each file. To process this large amount of data using lambda, each weekly file is broken down into 100 line chunks that are processed individually. This leads to between 20k and 35k lambda invocations.


Python setup instructions
-------------------------

[To be included in Readme]


Make sure you have Python 3 installed


> py


should run python 3.7. if it doesn't, install python 3.7 from https://www.python.org/downloads/


cd into the project directory and make a virtual environment:


	> cd D:\src\henry-ttd-project\
	> py -m venv venv


Then activate that virtual environment:


    > . .\venv\Scripts\activate


"." works in bash and powershell. In plain command prompt, just execute the activate command directly:


	d:\src\henry-ttd-project> venv\Scripts\activate


Your prompt should now tell you that you are in the `(venv)` environment:


    (venv) D:\src\henry-ttd-project >


Make sure you have the latest version of `pip` (Pythons package manager) installed:


	(venv) D:\src\henry-ttd-project > python -m pip install --upgrade pip


Once the virtual environment is active, install all the required packages:


 	(venv) D:\src\henry-ttd-project > pip install -r .\requirements.txt
