# TTD-Project
Summer project at theTradeDesk. The goal is to generate a csv file that has a match between mobile app ids and a corresponding ads.txt location on the web.


The data will be stored in AWS and the code is being written in Python 3.7.0.


The necessary Python libraries aside from the standard are listed in relevant_python_libraries.txt. Please install these before running.
