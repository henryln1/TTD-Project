# TTD-Project
Summer intern project at TheTradeDesk. Will replace with a better name later. Initial commit to set up repository.

The general goal of the project is to generate a text file that contains a line for each app with details about who is/isn't allowed to advertise on their platform. 

The data will be regularly updated in AWS, and the code will be written in Python 3.x.
