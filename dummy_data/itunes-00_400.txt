WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, and Voice Messages. \n\nWHY USE WHATSAPP:  \n\n• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.\n\n• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, and Voice Messages. \n\n• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can't access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp). \n\n• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer's browser.\n\n• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.* \n\n• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book. \n\n• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out. \n\n• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\n• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\n• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, email chat history, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n\n*Data charges may apply.

Players can also purchase an optional “Builders Club” membership, which provides extra privileges and a daily Robux stipend (tap the “More” tab at the bottom of the screen in the app, and then “Builders Club” to learn more). \n\nA network connection is required to play. Roblox games work best over Wi-Fi. \n \nALREADY A HAVE AN ACCOUNT?\nLogin to your existing Roblox account and play on the go!\n \nSUPPORT\nHelp: https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us\nContact: https://corp.roblox.com/contact/\n \nPRIVACY POLICY\nhttps://www.roblox.com/info/privacy\n \nPARENT’S GUIDE\nhttps://corp.roblox.com/parents/", "artistName": "Roblox Corporation", "artworkUrl60": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/c6/be/a9/c6bea96e-e040-f46c-588b-be462a697b7b/source/60x60bb.jpg", "advisories": ["Infrequent/Mild Cartoon or Fantasy Violence", "Infrequent/Mild Realistic Violence"], "iphone": true, "primaryGenreId": 6014, "primaryGenreName": "Games", "fileSizeBytes": "130262016", "releaseNotes": "To make Roblox work better for you, we deliver updates regularly.

Realms is a monthly subscription service that lets you create your own always-online Minecraft world.\nThere are currently two subscription options to choose from depending on how many people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously. A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

And remember, when in doubt, Swipe Right. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder—the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, swipe on over.\n \nMORE FEATURES?

But wait, it gets better. Save time and aimless swiping with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you before you swipe.

WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, and Voice Messages. \n\nWHY USE WHATSAPP:  \n\n• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.\n\n• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, and Voice Messages. \n\n• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can't access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp). \n\n• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer's browser.\n\n• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.* \n\n• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book. \n\n• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out. \n\n• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\n• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\n• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, email chat history, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n\n*Data charges may apply.

Players can also purchase an optional “Builders Club” membership, which provides extra privileges and a daily Robux stipend (tap the “More” tab at the bottom of the screen in the app, and then “Builders Club” to learn more). \n\nA network connection is required to play. Roblox games work best over Wi-Fi. \n \nALREADY A HAVE AN ACCOUNT?\nLogin to your existing Roblox account and play on the go!\n \nSUPPORT\nHelp: https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us\nContact: https://corp.roblox.com/contact/\n \nPRIVACY POLICY\nhttps://www.roblox.com/info/privacy\n \nPARENT’S GUIDE\nhttps://corp.roblox.com/parents/", "artistName": "Roblox Corporation", "artworkUrl60": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/c6/be/a9/c6bea96e-e040-f46c-588b-be462a697b7b/source/60x60bb.jpg", "advisories": ["Infrequent/Mild Cartoon or Fantasy Violence", "Infrequent/Mild Realistic Violence"], "iphone": true, "primaryGenreId": 6014, "primaryGenreName": "Games", "fileSizeBytes": "130262016", "releaseNotes": "To make Roblox work better for you, we deliver updates regularly.

Realms is a monthly subscription service that lets you create your own always-online Minecraft world.\nThere are currently two subscription options to choose from depending on how many people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously. A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

And remember, when in doubt, Swipe Right. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder—the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, swipe on over.\n \nMORE FEATURES?

But wait, it gets better. Save time and aimless swiping with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you before you swipe.

WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, and Voice Messages. \n\nWHY USE WHATSAPP:  \n\n• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.\n\n• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, and Voice Messages. \n\n• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can't access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp). \n\n• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer's browser.\n\n• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.* \n\n• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book. \n\n• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out. \n\n• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\n• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\n• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, email chat history, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n\n*Data charges may apply.

Players can also purchase an optional “Builders Club” membership, which provides extra privileges and a daily Robux stipend (tap the “More” tab at the bottom of the screen in the app, and then “Builders Club” to learn more). \n\nA network connection is required to play. Roblox games work best over Wi-Fi. \n \nALREADY A HAVE AN ACCOUNT?\nLogin to your existing Roblox account and play on the go!\n \nSUPPORT\nHelp: https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us\nContact: https://corp.roblox.com/contact/\n \nPRIVACY POLICY\nhttps://www.roblox.com/info/privacy\n \nPARENT’S GUIDE\nhttps://corp.roblox.com/parents/", "artistName": "Roblox Corporation", "artworkUrl60": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/c6/be/a9/c6bea96e-e040-f46c-588b-be462a697b7b/source/60x60bb.jpg", "advisories": ["Infrequent/Mild Cartoon or Fantasy Violence", "Infrequent/Mild Realistic Violence"], "iphone": true, "primaryGenreId": 6014, "primaryGenreName": "Games", "fileSizeBytes": "130262016", "releaseNotes": "To make Roblox work better for you, we deliver updates regularly.

Realms is a monthly subscription service that lets you create your own always-online Minecraft world.\nThere are currently two subscription options to choose from depending on how many people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously. A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

And remember, when in doubt, Swipe Right. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder—the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, swipe on over.\n \nMORE FEATURES?

But wait, it gets better. Save time and aimless swiping with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you before you swipe.

WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, and Voice Messages. \n\nWHY USE WHATSAPP:  \n\n• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.\n\n• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, and Voice Messages. \n\n• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can't access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp). \n\n• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer's browser.\n\n• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.* \n\n• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book. \n\n• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out. \n\n• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\n• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\n• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, email chat history, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n\n*Data charges may apply.

Players can also purchase an optional “Builders Club” membership, which provides extra privileges and a daily Robux stipend (tap the “More” tab at the bottom of the screen in the app, and then “Builders Club” to learn more). \n\nA network connection is required to play. Roblox games work best over Wi-Fi. \n \nALREADY A HAVE AN ACCOUNT?\nLogin to your existing Roblox account and play on the go!\n \nSUPPORT\nHelp: https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us\nContact: https://corp.roblox.com/contact/\n \nPRIVACY POLICY\nhttps://www.roblox.com/info/privacy\n \nPARENT’S GUIDE\nhttps://corp.roblox.com/parents/", "artistName": "Roblox Corporation", "artworkUrl60": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/c6/be/a9/c6bea96e-e040-f46c-588b-be462a697b7b/source/60x60bb.jpg", "advisories": ["Infrequent/Mild Cartoon or Fantasy Violence", "Infrequent/Mild Realistic Violence"], "iphone": true, "primaryGenreId": 6014, "primaryGenreName": "Games", "fileSizeBytes": "130262016", "releaseNotes": "To make Roblox work better for you, we deliver updates regularly.

Realms is a monthly subscription service that lets you create your own always-online Minecraft world.\nThere are currently two subscription options to choose from depending on how many people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously. A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

And remember, when in doubt, Swipe Right. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder—the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, swipe on over.\n \nMORE FEATURES?

But wait, it gets better. Save time and aimless swiping with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you before you swipe.
